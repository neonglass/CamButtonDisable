Glass Camera Button Disable

This application automatically disables the camera button when Glass is flipped
upside down. It applies this setting as soon as it is installed (or first run)
and will stop doing this if/when it is uninstalled. It's a simple, binary, on/off
functionality but my assumption here is that anyone who installs this does not
want Glass to be taking pictures upside down, ever.

Uninstall with:
adb uninstall com.appliedanalog.glass.disablecam
